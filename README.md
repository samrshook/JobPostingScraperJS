# JobPostingScraperJS

The goal of this little project was:
1) introduction to Cheerio's webscraping ability
2) a brush up on my javascript and a little node.js
3) help me track job postings from companies that I like to keep tabs on. 

Web scraper to pull job postings from the web with the Cheerio package, using a local host to display job titles and thier corresponding URLs.

Currently only pulling jobs with "analyst" in the title from a single site, but eventually, this will scale up to grab from several site.
